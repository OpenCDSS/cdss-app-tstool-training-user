# Script for "TSTool Training: Introduction to Commands"

This script can be read when creating the video for this training presentation.

## Title

1. Welcome to the training for TSTool software: "Introduction to Commands".
2. TSTool software is a part of Colorado's Decision Support Systems,
which is funded by the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB).
3. This is an introductory level lesson that is expected to take about 30 minutes.
4. The TSTool software can be run parallel to this presentation.
5. Pause and reposition the presentation as necessary to absorb the information.

## Command Files are Workflows to Support Decisions

1. Command files are workflows to support decisions.
2. A command workflow is saved as a text file with a list of commands.
3. These commands are read by TSTool and are run to process data.
4. The TSTool Command Processor maintains a list of time series, tables, datastores, and other data.
5. The unique identifiers for these objects allow TSTool to retrieve data for commands and save results.
6. The results are output as useful information products including files, visualizations, and databases.
